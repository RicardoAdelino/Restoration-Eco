##*Abstract*

Restoration practices are designed to reverse the negative effects of human activities on the environment, allowing the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem
functions. However, restoration activities require monitoring the recolonization of faunal assemblages to assess whether ecosystem functions and services performed by them have been recovered. Because of the presumed link between species traits and ecosystem functioning, a potential solution to evaluate
restoration efficiency is the grouping of species based on their ecological functions. Here, we review studies on bird assemblages of active restoration sites 
in Brazil and apply a data-driven approach to group bird species into functional groups using species trait information. We reviewed if studies provided 
detailed information (e.g., data on species composition and abundance) for comparative analyses and evaluated how restoration time (i.e., how long-ago 
restoration started) affected the similarity in bird species composition considering three restoration age classes: recent, intermediate, and old. We also
tested whether the composition of bird functional groups varies in restoration sites of different age classes. Although we found a small number of studies (n
=â€‰8) with birds in restoration areas, we compiled a dataset consisting of 232 bird species from 14 different restoration sites. We found that bird assemblages
from recent restoration sites (up to 5 years) were dissimilar to bird assemblages from older restoration sites (over 20 years). Also, older restoration sites
had a higher occurrence of more specialist functional groups (e.g., small frugivores birds of superior stratum). Despite the small number of studies, our
results reinforce the sensitivity of birds to habitat changes and their potential in indicating restoration efficiency. We argue for the necessity of
standardized protocols in the collection and reporting of data on restoration activities, which will improve comparative analysis in theoretical and applied 
restoration ecology.
